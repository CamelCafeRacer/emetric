Note: this is intended as a playground to look at data. You probably
shouldn't really try to use this. 


I tried to make this easy on osx, I probably failed.

* Install
  - install port from http://www.macports.org/
  - sudo port -v selfupdate
  - sudo port install py26-numpy
  - sudo port install py26-matplotlib


* Run
  - /opt/local/bin/python2.6 emetric/priv/plotr/plotr.py
    --data=path/to/file.csv --out=path/to/out.csv

  This will generate a new csv file with all the uninteresting data
  filtered out. At this point you can import into a spreadsheet and
  make pretty graphs. Or you can make a very unsupported attempt to
  get pygtk installed. Then you can use the --graph option and let
  matplotlib to all the graphing for you.
